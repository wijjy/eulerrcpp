## Project 5

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

I would say this is 

$$20 \times 19 \times 3 \times 3 \times 17 \times 2 \times 2 \times 7 \times 13 \times 11 $$

I don't know how you would use code to do it except by the stupidest of brute force.  I suppose you could collect up the prime factors of all the numbers up and including 20, and then find out the maximum number of each of them needed.



```{r}
20*19*3*3*17*2*2*7*13*11

```
