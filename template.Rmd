## Project 5

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

```{Rcpp}
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
NumericVector timesTwo(NumericVector x) {
  return x * 2;
}
```


```{r}
timesTwo(8)
```
