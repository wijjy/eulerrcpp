## Project 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```{Rcpp}
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
int evenfib(int mx) {
  int x1=1, x2=2;
  int sum=2;
  for (;;) {
    int x3=x1+x2;
    if (x3 >= mx) break;
    if (x3%2==0) sum += x3;
    x1=x2;
    x2=x3;
  }
  return sum;
}

```


```{r}
evenfib(4000000)
```
