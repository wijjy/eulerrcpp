## Project 4
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


### Notes

The largest is going to have six digits.  So will look like $ghiihg$

$abc \times def = ghiihg$

Hence
$cf \mod 10 = g$

And there will be other relationships, but these are more complicated.

Easier may be to count down the palindromic numbers starting from $999999$, and then trying to factorise.  When it 
can be   factored as the product of two 3-digit numbers then bingo.



```{Rcpp}
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
NumericVector timesTwo(NumericVector x) {
  return x * 2;
}
```


```{r}
timesTwo(8)
```
